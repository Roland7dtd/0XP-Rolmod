# 0XP-Rolmod
This is a modlet pack that changes the vanilla 7 Days to Die game to de-emphasize xp incentives.
Roland's Improved Death Ambiguity Mod removes the death sound, death animation, and increases the range for the get up animation.
Roland's zero-xp Progression removes xp from actions and awards levels and skillpoints for completing quests.
The Skillpoint Generator provides an automatic skillpoint award every day (based on default 60 minute days) as long as you don't die.
The Skillpoint Generator requires SDX and the script folder contains the required file for the generator.
